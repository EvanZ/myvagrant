# # **Text Analysis and Entity Resolution**
# ####Entity resolution is a common, yet difficult problem in data cleaning and integration. This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to apply powerful and scalable text analysis techniques and perform entity resolution across two datasets of commercial products.

# #### Entity Resolution, or "[Record linkage][wiki]" is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists, and historians, among others, to describe the process of joining records from one data source with another that describe the same entity. Our terms with the same meaning include, "entity disambiguation/linking", duplicate detection", "deduplication", "record matching", "(reference) reconciliation", "object identification", "data/information integration", and "conflation".
# #### Entity Resolution (ER) refers to the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, databases). ER is necessary when joining datasets based on entities that may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), as may be the case due to differences in record shape, storage location, and/or curator style or preference. A dataset that has undergone ER may be referred to as being cross-linked.

# ### Code
# #### This assignment can be completed using basic Python, pySpark Transformations and actions, and the plotting library matplotlib. Other libraries are not allowed.
# ### Files
# #### Data files for this assignment are from the [metric-learning](https://code.google.com/p/metric-learning/) project and can be found at:
# `cs100/lab3`
# #### The directory contains the following files:
# * **Google.csv**, the Google Products dataset
# * **Amazon.csv**, the Amazon dataset
# * **Google_small.csv**, 200 records sampled from the Google data
# * **Amazon_small.csv**, 200 records sampled from the Amazon data
# * **Amazon_Google_perfectMapping.csv**, the "gold standard" mapping
# * **stopwords.txt**, a list of common English words
# #### Besides the complete data files, there are "sample" data files for each dataset - we will use these for **Part 1**. In addition, there is a "gold standard" file that contains all of the true mappings between entities in the two datasets. Every row in the gold standard file has a pair of record IDs (one Google, one Amazon) that belong to two record that describe the same thing in the real world. We will use the gold standard to evaluate our algorithms.

# ### **Part 0: Preliminaries**
# #### We read in each of the files and create an RDD consisting of lines.
# #### For each of the data files ("Google.csv", "Amazon.csv", and the samples), we want to parse the IDs out of each record. The IDs are the first column of the file (they are URLs for Google, and alphanumeric strings for Amazon). Omitting the headers, we load these data files into pair RDDs where the *mapping ID* is the key, and the value is a string consisting of the name/title, description, and manufacturer from the record.
# #### The file format of an Amazon line is:
#    `"id","title","description","manufacturer","price"`
# #### The file format of a Google line is:
#    `"id","name","description","manufacturer","price"`

# ### **Part 1: ER as Text Similarity - Bags of Words**
# #### A simple approach to entity resolution is to treat all records as strings and compute their similarity with a string distance function. In this part, we will build some components for performing bag-of-words text-analysis, and then use them to compute record similarity.
# #### [Bag-of-words][bag-of-words] is a conceptually simple yet powerful approach to text analysis.
# #### The idea is to treat strings, a.k.a. **documents**, as *unordered collections* of words, or **tokens**, i.e., as bags of words.
# > #### **Note on terminology**: a "token" is the result of parsing the document down to the elements we consider "atomic" for the task at hand.  Tokens can be things like words, numbers, acronyms, or other exotica like word-roots or fixed-length character strings.
# > #### Bag of words techniques all apply to any sort of token, so when we say "bag-of-words" we really mean "bag-of-tokens," strictly speaking.
# #### Tokens become the atomic unit of text comparison. If we want to compare two documents, we count how many tokens they share in common. If we want to search for documents with keyword queries (this is what Google does), then we turn the keywords into tokens and find documents that contain them. The power of this approach is that it makes string comparisons insensitive to small differences that probably do not affect meaning much, for example, punctuation and word order.
# [bag-of-words]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model

# ### **1(a) Tokenize a String**
# #### Implement the function `simpleTokenize(string)` that takes a string and returns a list of non-empty tokens in the string. `simpleTokenize` should split strings using the provided regular expression. Since we want to make token-matching case insensitive, make sure all tokens are turned lower-case. Give an interpretation, in natural language, of what the regular expression, `split_regex`, matches.
# #### If you need help with Regular Expressions, try the site [regex101](https://regex101.com/) where you can interactively explore the results of applying different regular expressions to strings. *Note that \W includes the "_" character*.  You should use [re.split()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.split) to perform the string split. Also, make sure you remove any empty tokens.

# ### **Part 2: ER as Text Similarity - Weighted Bag-of-Words using TF-IDF**
# #### Bag-of-words comparisons are not very good when all tokens are treated the same: some tokens are more important than others. Weights give us a way to specify which tokens to favor. With weights, when we compare documents, instead of counting common tokens, we sum up the weights of common tokens. A good heuristic for assigning weights is called "Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency," or [TF-IDF][tfidf] for short.
# #### **TF**
# #### TF rewards tokens that appear many times in the same document. It is computed as the frequency of a token in a document, that is, if document *d* contains 100 tokens and token *t* appears in *d* 5 times, then the TF weight of *t* in *d* is *5/100 = 1/20*. The intuition for TF is that if a word occurs often in a document, then it is more important to the meaning of the document.
# #### **IDF**
# #### IDF rewards tokens that are rare overall in a dataset. The intuition is that it is more significant if two documents share a rare word than a common one. IDF weight for a token, *t*, in a set of documents, *U*, is computed as follows:
# * #### Let *N* be the total number of documents in *U*
# * #### Find *n(t)*, the number of documents in *U* that contain *t*
# * #### Then *IDF(t) = N/n(t)*.
# #### Note that *n(t)/N* is the frequency of *t* in *U*, and *N/n(t)* is the inverse frequency.
# > #### **Note on terminology**: Sometimes token weights depend on the document the token belongs to, that is, the same token may have a different weight when it's found in different documents.  We call these weights *local* weights.  TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.  On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights *global*, and IDF is one such weight.
# #### **TF-IDF**
# #### Finally, to bring it all together, the total TF-IDF weight for a token in a document is the product of its TF and IDF weights.
# [tfidf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf

# ### **(2a) Implement a TF function**
# #### Implement `tf(tokens)` that takes a list of tokens and returns a Python [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) mapping tokens to TF weights.
# #### The steps your function should perform are:
# * #### Create an empty Python dictionary
# * #### For each of the tokens in the input `tokens` list, count 1 for each occurance and add the token to the dictionary
# * #### For each of the tokens in the dictionary, divide the token's count by the total number of tokens in the input `tokens` list

# ### **(2b) Create a corpus**

# ### **(2c) Implement an IDFs function**
# #### Implement `idfs` that assigns an IDF weight to every unique token in an RDD called `corpus`. The function should return an pair RDD where the `key` is the unique token and value is the IDF weight for the token.
# #### Recall that the IDF weight for a token, *t*, in a set of documents, *U*, is computed as follows:
# * #### Let *N* be the total number of documents in *U*.
# * #### Find *n(t)*, the number of documents in *U* that contain *t*.
# * #### Then *IDF(t) = N/n(t)*.
# #### The steps your function should perform are:
# * #### Calculate *N*. Think about how you can calculate *N* from the input RDD.
# * #### Create an RDD (*not a pair RDD*) containing the unique tokens from each document in the input `corpus`. For each document, you should only include a token once, *even if it appears multiple times in that document.*
# * #### For each of the unique tokens, count how many times it appears in the document and then compute the IDF for that token: *N/n(t)*
# #### Use your `idfs` to compute the IDF weights for all tokens in `corpusRDD` (the combined small datasets).
# #### How many unique tokens are there?

# ### **(2f) Implement a TF-IDF function**
# #### Use your `tf` function to implement a `tfidf(tokens, idfs)` function that takes a list of tokens from a document and a Python dictionary of IDF weights and returns a Python dictionary mapping individual tokens to total TF-IDF weights.
# #### The steps your function should perform are:
# * #### Calculate the token frequencies (TF) for `tokens`
# * #### Create a Python dictionary where each token maps to the token's frequency times the token's IDF weight
# #### Use your `tfidf` function to compute the weights of Amazon product record 'b000hkgj8k'. To do this, we need to extract the record for the token from the tokenized small Amazon dataset and we need to convert the IDFs for the small dataset into a Python dictionary. We can do the first part, by using a `filter()` transformation to extract the matching record and a `collect()` action to return the value to the driver. For the second part, we use the [`collectAsMap()` action](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.collectAsMap) to return the IDFs to the driver as a Python dictionary.

# ### **Part 3: ER as Text Similarity - Cosine Similarity**
# #### Now we are ready to do text comparisons in a formal way. The metric of string distance we will use is called **[cosine similarity][cosine]**. We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space. Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors. This is *much* easier than it sounds.
# #### The first question to answer is how do we represent documents as vectors? The answer is familiar: bag-of-words! We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions. For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string "Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!" as a vector. Then in the "hello" and "goodbye" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the "world" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.
# #### The next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them? Recall the formula for the dot product of two vectors:
# #### $$ a \cdot b = \| a \| \| b \| \cos \theta $$
# #### Here $ a \cdot b = \sum a_i b_i $ is the ordinary dot product of two vectors, and $ \|a\| = \sqrt{ \sum a_i^2 } $ is the norm of $ a $.
# #### We can rearrange terms and solve for the cosine to find it is simply the normalized dot product of the vectors. With our vector model, the dot product and norm computations are simple functions of the bag-of-words document representations, so we now have a formal way to compute similarity:
# #### $$ similarity = \cos \theta = \frac{a \cdot b}{\|a\| \|b\|} = \frac{\sum a_i b_i}{\sqrt{\sum a_i^2} \sqrt{\sum b_i^2}} $$
# #### Setting aside the algebra, the geometric interpretation is more intuitive. The angle between two document vectors is small if they share many tokens in common, because they are pointing in roughly the same direction. For that case, the cosine of the angle will be large. Otherwise, if the angle is large (and they have few words in common), the cosine is small. Therefore, cosine similarity scales proportionally with our intuitive sense of similarity.

# ### **(3a) Implement the components of a `cosineSimilarity` function**
# #### Implement the components of a `cosineSimilarity` function.
# #### Use the `tokenize` and `tfidf` functions, and the IDF weights from Part 2 for extracting tokens and assigning them weights.
# #### The steps you should perform are:

# * #### Define a function `norm` that returns the square root of the dot product of a dictionary and itself
# * #### Define a function `cossim` that returns the dot product of two dictionaries divided by the norm of the first dictionary and then by the norm of the second dictionary

# * #### Define a worker function that given an element from the combination RDD computes the cosineSimlarity for the two records in the element

# #### The solution in (3c) works well for small datasets, but it requires Spark to (automatically) send the `idfsSmallWeights` variable to all the workers.

# #### Instead, we can use a broadcast variable - we define the broadcast variable in the driver and then we can refer to it in each worker. Spark saves the broadcast variable at each worker, so it is only sent once.
# #### The steps you should perform are:
# * #### Define a `computeSimilarityBroadcast` function that given an element from the combination RDD computes the cosine simlarity for the two records in the element. This will be the same as the worker function `computeSimilarity` in (3c) except that it uses a broadcast variable.

# * #### How many true duplicate pairs are there in the small datasets?
# * #### What is the average similarity score for true duplicates?
# * #### What about for non-duplicates?

# * #### Create a new `sims` RDD from the `similaritiesBroadcast` RDD, where each element consists of a pair of the form ("AmazonID GoogleURL", cosineSimilarityScore). An example entry from `sims` is: ('b000bi7uqs http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/18403148885652932189', 0.40202896125621296)

# * #### Count the number of true duplicate pairs in the `trueDupsRDD` dataset

# ### **Part 4: Scalable ER**
# #### In the previous parts, we built a text similarity function and used it for small scale entity resolution.  Our implementation is limited by its quadratic run time complexity, and is not practical for even modestly sized datasets.  In this part, we will implement a more scalable algorithm and use it to do entity resolution on the full dataset.
# ### Inverted Indices
# #### To improve our ER algorithm from the earlier parts, we should begin by analyzing its running time. In particular, the algorithm above is quadratic in two ways. First, we did a lot of redundant computation of tokens and weights, since each record was reprocessed every time it was compared. Second, we made quadratically many token comparisons between records.
# #### The first source of quadratic overhead can be eliminated with precomputation and look-up tables, but the second source is a little more tricky. In the worst case, every token in every record in one dataset exists in every record in the other dataset, and therefore every token makes a non-zero contribution to the cosine similarity. In this case, token comparison is unavoidably quadratic.
# #### But in reality most records have nothing (or very little) in common. Moreover, it is typical for a record in one dataset to have at most one duplicate record in the other dataset (this is the case assuming each dataset has been de-duplicated against itself). In this case, the output is linear in the size of the input and we can hope to achieve linear running time.
# #### An [**inverted index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure that will allow us to avoid making quadratically many token comparisons.  It maps each token in the dataset to the list of documents that contain the token.  So, instead of comparing, record by record, each token to every other token to see if they match, we will use inverted indices to *look up* records that match on a particular token.
# > #### **Note on terminology**: In text search, a *forward* index maps documents in a dataset to the tokens they contain.  An *inverted* index supports the inverse mapping.
# > #### **Note**: For this section, use the complete Google and Amazon datasets, not the samples

# ### **(4f) Identify common tokens from the full dataset**
# #### Use the data structures from parts **(4a)** and **(4e)** to build a dictionary to map record pairs to cosine similarity scores.
# #### The steps you should perform are:
# * #### Create two broadcast dictionaries from the amazonWeights and googleWeights RDDs
# * #### Create a `fastCosinesSimilarity` function that takes in a record consisting of the pair ((Amazon ID, Google URL), tokens list) and computes the sum for each of the tokens in the token list of the products of the Amazon weight for the token times the Google weight for the token. The sum should then be divided by the norm for the Google URL and then divided by the norm for the Amazon ID. The function should return this value in a pair with the key being the (Amazon ID, Google URL). *Make sure you use broadcast variables you created for both the weights and norms*
# * #### Apply your `fastCosinesSimilarity` function to the common tokens from the full dataset

# ### **Part 5: Analysis**
# #### Now we have an authoritative list of record-pair similarities, but we need a way to use those similarities to decide if two records are duplicates or not. The simplest approach is to pick a **threshold**. Pairs whose similarity is above the threshold are declared duplicates, and pairs below the threshold are declared distinct.
# #### To decide where to set the threshold we need to understand what kind of errors result at different levels. If we set the threshold too low, we get more **false positives**, that is, record-pairs we say are duplicates that in reality are not. If we set the threshold too high, we get more **false negatives**, that is, record-pairs that really are duplicates but that we miss.
# #### ER algorithms are evaluated by the common metrics of information retrieval and search called **precision** and **recall**. Precision asks of all the record-pairs marked duplicates, what fraction are true duplicates? Recall asks of all the true duplicates in the data, what fraction did we successfully find? As with false positives and false negatives, there is a trade-off between precision and recall. A third metric, called **F-measure**, takes the harmonic mean of precision and recall to measure overall goodness in a single value:
# #### $$ Fmeasure = 2 \frac{precision * recall}{precision + recall} $$
# > #### **Note**: In this part, we use the "gold standard" mapping from the included file to look up true duplicates, and the results of Part 4.
# > #### **Note**: In this part, you will not be writing any code. We've written all of the code for you. Run each cell and then answer the quiz questions on Studio.

# ### **(5a) Counting True Positives, False Positives, and False Negatives**
# #### We need functions that count True Positives (true duplicates above the threshold), and False Positives and False Negatives:
# * #### We start with creating the `simsFullRDD` from our `similaritiesFullRDD` that consists of a pair of ((Amazon ID, Google URL), simlarity score)
# * #### From this RDD, we create an RDD consisting of only the similarity scores
# * #### To look up the similarity scores for true duplicates, we perform a left outer join using the `goldStandard` RDD and `simsFullRDD` and extract the

# In[45]:

# Create an RDD of ((Amazon ID, Google URL), similarity score)
simsFullRDD = similaritiesFullRDD.map(lambda x: ("%s %s" % (x[0][0], x[0][1]), x[1]))
assert (simsFullRDD.count() == 2441100)

# Create an RDD of just the similarity scores
simsFullValuesRDD = (simsFullRDD
                     .map(lambda x: x[1])
                     .cache())
assert (simsFullValuesRDD.count() == 2441100)

# Look up all similarity scores for true duplicates

# This helper function will return the similarity score for records that are in the gold standard and the simsFullRDD (True positives), and will return 0 for records that are in the gold standard but not in simsFullRDD (False Negatives).
def gs_value(record):
    if (record[1][1] is None):
        return 0
    else:
        return record[1][1]

# Join the gold standard and simsFullRDD, and then extract the similarities scores using the helper function
trueDupSimsRDD = (goldStandard
                  .leftOuterJoin(simsFullRDD)
                  .map(gs_value)
                  .cache())
print 'There are %s true duplicates.' % trueDupSimsRDD.count()
assert(trueDupSimsRDD.count() == 1300)


# #### The next step is to pick a threshold between 0 and 1 for the count of True Positives (true duplicates above the threshold). However, we would like to explore many different thresholds. To do this, we divide the space of thresholds into 100 bins, and take the following actions:
# * #### We use Spark Accumulators to implement our counting function. We define a custom accumulator type, `VectorAccumulatorParam`, along with functions to initialize the accumulator's vector to zero, and to add two vectors. Note that we have to use the += operator because you can only add to an accumulator.
# * #### We create a helper function to create a list with one entry (bit) set to a value and all others set to 0.
# * #### We create 101 bins for the 100 threshold values between 0 and 1.
# * #### Now, for each similarity score, we can compute the false positives. We do this by adding each similarity score to the appropriate bin of the vector. Then we remove true positives from the vector by using the gold standard data.
# * #### We define functions for computing false positive and negative and true positives, for a given threshold.

# ### **(5c) Line Plots**
# #### We can make line plots of precision, recall, and F-measure as a function of threshold value, for thresholds between 0.0 and 1.0.  You can change `nthresholds` (above in part **(5a)**) to change the threshold values to plot.

# ### Discussion
# #### State-of-the-art tools can get an F-measure of about 60% on this dataset. In this lab exercise, our best F-measure is closer to 40%. Look at some examples of errors (both False Positives and False Negatives) and think about what went wrong.
# ### There are several ways we might improve our simple classifier, including:
# #### * Using additional attributes
# #### * Performing better featurization of our textual data (e.g., stemming, n-grams, etc.)
# #### * Using different similarity functions
